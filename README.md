# Crack Detection and Segmentation

It is an advanced tool designed to detect, segment, and measure cracks in structures. This project uses machine learning models to detect cracks and provides detailed insights, including the length and width of the identified cracks. 

## Features
- **Crack Detection**: Automatically identifies cracks in images or structural scans.
- **Crack Segmentation**: Provides a detailed segmentation of crack areas for further analysis.
- **Measurement**: Calculates the length and width of detected cracks for reporting and maintenance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAKETH-RSK/crack-detection.git
